# React and Typescript Application: Building Trello with Drag and Drop

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

This project will create a simplified version of a kanban board. A popular example of such an application is *Trello*.

In Trello, you can create tasks and organize them into lists. You can drag both cards and lists to reorder them. You can also add comments and attach files to your tasks.

In this application will recreate only the core functionality: creating tasks, making lists and dragging them around.
